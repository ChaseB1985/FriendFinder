FriendFinder
This full-stack site will take in results from user surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

This app includes data validation and links to the api of friends currently in the system. 
This app will let the user take a survey and depending on their choices it will match them with a new friend, a CareBear to be specific.
